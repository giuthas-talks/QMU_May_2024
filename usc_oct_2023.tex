\title{Analysing Articulatory Data with Vector Norms and Related Methods}
\date{9 Oct 2023}

\frame{\frametitle{Outline}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I will then talk about what we can and cannot do with these methods in
    time domain analysis of articulatory data these days. I will take short side
    trips to look at similar methods applied to other articulatory data. We have
    looked at tongue splines and lip videos and I will discuss what kind of
    challenges and understanding has resulted from those attempts. Finally,
    analysing 3D/4D ultrasound has been a recent major focus, but unfortunately
    frame rate issues are not so easy to solve.
    \item I will finish the talk by discussing why MRI would be very interesting
    to analyse with these methods -- or adapted versions of them -- and which
    definite and possible challenges one might come across.
  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Introduction: The why}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Pre-speech articulation is interesting from several points of view, but
  analysing ultrasound videos manually is not great.
  \item In my thesis I concentrated on timing of utterance onset in both
  acoustics and articulation \citep{Palo-MeasuringPrespeechArticulation-2019}.
  \item The data was high-speed tongue ultrasound from a delayed naming
  experiment -- specifically one using the Rastle instructions, see
  \cite{RastleEtAl-CharacterizingMotorExecution-2005}.
  \end{itemize} 

  % TODO: add a picture of ultrasound here and Rastle timeline

\frame{\frametitle{Introduction: The why}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When trying to identify movement onset in grayscale videos with a lot of
  speckle 'noise', it doesn't take long to grow a desire for an easier way.
  \item \kommentti{explain speckle noise and tongue ultrasound}
  \item The first tool out of the box happened to work adequately --  and so for my
  thesis I used Euclidean distance to identify articulatory
