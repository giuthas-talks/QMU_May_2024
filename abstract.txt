PD (and other things) since PhD -- Work on speech timing and methodology

This talk will focus on speech timing and the related methodological work I
have done since graduating in 2019. At the center will be Pixel Difference (PD)
which is a method for evaluating overall change in ultrasound (and other image
sequence) data. I first employed PD to identify articulatory onsets in
ultrasound recordings of a delayed naming experiment. I have since done more
work on speech initiation, and expanded the analysis to the rest of the
utterance. However, I have mainly concentrated on methodological issues that
have risen from trying to use PD on 3D/4D ultrasound and from trying to
validate PD against spline-based metrics.
