PD (and other things) since PhD -- Work on speech timing and methodology

This talk will focus on speech timing and the related methodological work I
have done since graduating in 2019. At the center of this is Pixel Difference
which is a method for evaluating overall change in ultrasound (and other image
sequence) data. I first employed Pixel Difference to identify articulatory
onsets in ultrasound recordings of a delayed naming experiment. In this talk, I
will introduce timing results and describe my work on Pixel Difference -- in
effect using vector norms to analyse overall change in ultrasound (and other)
video sequences.
